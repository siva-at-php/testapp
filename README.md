## A test app using the Zend framework.

### Contributing

* First clone the repo.
* Check out your own branch.
* Make changes, add a commit.
* Push changes to your branch (NOT master).
* Create a pull request comparing your new branch to Master.
* Get two other team members to review the changes, commenting as needed.
* If there are any changes requested by other team members, make them, add a new commit, and push to the branch again.  The changes will automatically show up in the pull request.
* Once two members comment "Approved by peer", rebase from master to make sure your branch is synced up with the latest (if someone else had a pull request approved while yours was being reviewed).
* Finally, merge into master.
